# Occupancy Monitoring
a client-server application where clients represent occupancy sensors, capable of sending occupancy data points and requesting aggregated occupancy data. The server stores these data points &amp; provides the aggregated occupancy data as a 2D array upon request. New data points from clients overwrites old values on the server for the same coordinates.
